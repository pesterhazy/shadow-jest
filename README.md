Experiment in getting Shadow-cljs to work with Jest

Rationale: Jest is a much better test runner than anything available for ClojureScript, makes integration with jsdom and React Testing Library easy and supports parallel test runs in node.

# Usage

```
npm run dev
npm run test
```

# About TodoMVC

[TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com/) is, by convention, the first demo app to build as a frontend application, and it's been around for years. It has just enough state to warrant a framework like React. It brings us the joy of building a frontend app [with an existing specification](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/app-spec.md) without worrying about the [CSS](https://unpkg.com/todomvc-app-css@2.4.1/index.css).

Check out [an example written in pure React](https://todomvc.com/examples/react/#/)
